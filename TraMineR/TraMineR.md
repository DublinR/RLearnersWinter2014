TraMineR: a toolbox for exploring sequence data
=========================================
TraMineR is a R-package for mining, describing and visualizing sequences of states or events, and more generally discrete sequence data. Its primary aim is the analysis of biographical longitudinal data in the social sciences, such as data describing careers or family trajectories. However, most of its features also apply to many other kinds of categorical sequence data. They include:
Handling of longitudinal data and conversion between various sequence formats
Plotting sequences (density plot, frequency plot, index plot and more)
Individual longitudinal characteristics of sequences (length, time in each state, longitudinal entropy, turbulence, complexity and more)
Sequence transversal characteristics by age point (transversal state distribution, transversal entropy, modal state)
Other aggregated characteristics (transition rates, average duration in each state, sequence frequency)
Dissimilarities between pairs of sequences (Optimal matching, longest common subsequence, Hamming, Dynamic Hamming, Multichannel and more)
Medoid and heterogeneity measure of a set of sequences
Discovering and plotting representative sequences
ANOVA-like analysis of sequences and tree structured ANOVA from dissimilarities
Parallel coordinate plot of event sequences
Extracting frequent event subsequences
Identifying most discriminating event subsequences
Association rules between subsequences
