## SuperWorld

The objective is to create a "personal data" data set for use in workshops. The context of the data set is intentionally whimsical, using many pop-cultural references (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Twilight, Hitchhikers Guide)

1. There should be a large number of cases. To start with 25,000 cases (but we could easily ramp it up to 250,000).
2. There should be a large number of variables too.
3. It contain a variety of variable types, numeric, categorical, character, locational, boolean, binary etc.
4. It should allow for crosstabulation and Chi square of categorical variables.
5. It should allow for multiple advanced statistical modelling techniques (PCA, Logistic Regression, Cluster Analysis).
6. There are scenarios for derived variables (for example using Heights and Weights to compute BMI, using dplyr mutate function).
