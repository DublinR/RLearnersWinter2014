\section{FactoMineR}


The \textbf{\textit{FactoMineR}} package offers a large number of additional functions for exploratory factor analysis. 
This includes the use of both quantitative and qualitative variables, as well as the inclusion of supplementary variables and observations. 
Here is an example of the types of graphs that you can create with this package.

\begin{verbatim}
# PCA Variable Factor Map 
library(FactoMineR)
result <- PCA(mydata) 
# graphs generated automatically 
\end{verbatim}

The GPARotation package offers a wealth of rotation options beyond varimax and promax.
