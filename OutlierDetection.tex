Outlier 
Outliers make statistical analyses difficult. 
This calculator performs Grubbs' test, also called the ESD method (extreme studentized deviate), to determine whether one of the values in the list you enter is a signficant outlier from the rest. Learn more about the principles of outlier detection and exactly how this test works.
