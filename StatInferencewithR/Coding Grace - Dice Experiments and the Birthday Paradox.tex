\title{Rolling Dice with \texttt{R}}
\author{Coding Grace  and Dublin \texttt{R}}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Probability}
Prerequisites
\begin{itemize}
\item Vectors
\item Creating numeric vector
\item Programming Control Statements - FOR loops
\item Basic Statistical Commands such as \texttt{mean()} and \texttt{quantile()}
\end{itemize}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Sequence of Integers}
A sequence of integers can be created using the “:” operator, specifying the upper and lower bounds on either side. This is very useful for Dice experiments. Importantly this sequence is constructed as a numeric vector.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
1:10
5:1
Dice = 1:6
Dice
class(Dice)
mode(Dice)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\begin{verbatim}
> 1:10
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> 5:1
[1] 5 4 3 2 1
> Dice = 1:6
> Dice
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
> class(Dice)
[1] "integer"
> mode(Dice)
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

We can also construct other sequences using the sequence of integers as part of the calculation.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
0:5
0:5 + 1
0:5 + 0.5
0:5/5
0:5*5
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> 0:5
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5
> 0:5 + 1
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
> 0:5 + 0.5
[1] 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5
> 0:5/5
[1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0
> 0:5*5
[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25
> 
\end{verbatim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Playing with Dice}


Another important command is the \texttt{sample()} command. This command causes \texttt{R} to select $n$ items from the specified vector. We can use it to simulate one roll of a die.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
Dice = 1:6
sample(Dice,1)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 2 
> 
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 4 
>
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 1
> 
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Sampling Without Replacement and With Replacement}
\noindent Suppose we wish to simulate two rolls of a die. Surely we just specify 2 in the argument of the \texttt{sample()} command. In fact we do, but this is not enough.
The \texttt{sample()} command works on the default basis of \textbf{\textit{sampling without replacement}}. That is to say: once a number has been selected, it can not be selected again.
\begin{verbatim}
> sample(Dice,6)
[1] 4 3 6 1 2 5
> sample(Dice,7)
Error in sample(Dice, 7) : 
  cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'
\end{verbatim}
Sampling without replacement is appropriate if we are selecting lottery numbers. You can only pick a particular number once.
\begin{verbatim}
> Lotto=1:42
> sample(Lotto,6)
[1]  2 38 19 10  3 27
> 
\end{verbatim}

Going back to multiple dice rolls, what we do here is to additionally specify \texttt{replace=TRUE}. This specifies an experiment where there is \textbf{\textit{sampling with replacement}}. Let us simulate 20 dice rolls. We can also use the \texttt{table()} function to study the outcomes of the simulation. This command tells use how many times each outcome (number) came up. (This is called a \textbf{frequency table}). Out of interest, we will compute the mean value of the dice rolls using the \texttt{mean()} command.
\begin{verbatim}
> sample(Dice,20,replace=TRUE)
 [1] 4 1 3 2 5 4 4 4 6 5 6 6 5 6 6 5 1 1 1 3
>
> X= sample(Dice,20,replace=TRUE)
> table(X)
X
1 2 3 4 5 6 
4 4 2 3 3 4 
> mean(X)
[1] 3.45
\end{verbatim}


Let us roll dice 300 times.  Each of the six outcome is equally likely,  so we will expect 50 realisations of each number.  But that rarely happens, as \textbf{Sampling fluctation} comes into play.
In the table below, we see that the number 2 comes up thirteen more times than the number 3. Is there something wrong? A hidden bias in our code? No. It is just a random occurence.

%-----------------------------------%
\begin{verbatim}
> X=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
> table(X)
X
 1  2  3  4  5  6 
48 57 44 55 51 45 
> mean(X)
[1] 3.463333
 hist(X,breaks=c(0:6 + 0.5),col=c("red","blue","green"))
\end{verbatim}
 
A bar chart known as a \textbf{\textit{histogram}} to accompany this frequency table can be constructed using the following code. The command \texttt{hist()} is used to construct the histogram. The argument \texttt{breaks} is used to specify the lower and upper bounds of each interval (the sides of each of the columns).
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
 hist(X,breaks=c(0:6 + 0.5),col=c("red","blue","green"))

\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
%--------------------------------------%
\subsection{Rolling Two Dice}
So far we have simulated the roll of one die. Many games would use two dice rolled together, with an outcome between 2 and 12. A first guess would simply be to specify a certain numbers sampled with replacement from a sequence of integers 2 to 12. Wrong! 
For one die, each outcome is equally likely. For a two dice experiment, there are differences in the probability of each outcome occuring, with 2 and 12  being the least likely outcomes, while 7 is the most likely outcome.
Let roll two dice $X$ and $Y$ seperately, and then add the two numbers from each together (calling this addition $Z$.)


\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
X=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
Y=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
Z=X+Y
table(Z)
hist(Z,breaks=c(1:12 + 0.5),col=c("red","blue","green","yellow"))
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> X=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
> Y=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
> Z=X+Y
> table(Z)
Z
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 
 8 18 19 38 41 56 32 28 26 23 11
\end{veratim}




%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Dice Rolls Sums Experiment}
Let work on the basis of 100 dice rolls, and for the sake of simplicity let us consider the \textbf{sum} of those 100 single die-rolls. Importantly, we are simulating a \textbf{fair} die. The lowest mathematially possible value is 100, while the highest possible value is 600. We expect to get a value of approximately 350, halfway between the minimum and maximum, but each time we perform the experiment there will be slight fluctuations.  Try the last line of the code below a few times. How many times do you get a figure less than 340 or greater than 360?
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
X= sample(Dice,100,replace=TRUE)
sum(X)

#Equivalently
sum(sample(Dice,100,replace=TRUE))
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\subsection{The Birthday function}
The R command \texttt{pbirthday()} computes the probability of a coincidence of a number of randomly chosen people sharing a birthday, given that there are $n$ people to choose from.
Suppose there are four people in a room. The probability of two of them sharing a birthday can be computed as follows: (Answer:  about 1.6 \%)
\begin{verbatim}
> pbirthday(4)
[1] 0.01635591
\end{verbatim}



\noindent How many people do you need for a greater than 50\% chance of a shared birthday for n people? Many would make the guess 183 people.  Let us use the \texttt{sapply()} command. The first arguments is the data set (here a sequence of integers from 2 to 60) and then the command or function (here \texttt{pbirthday()}, but specified without the brackets.
(starting from 2 – so the 5th element corresponds to 6 people, etc)
\begin{verbatim}
 > sapply(2:60,pbirthday)

[57] 0.991664979 0.992989448 0.994122661
\end{verbatim}
The answer is 23 people (see entry 22)- probably much less than you thought!!
