\section*{Imputation}
Imputation, the practice of '\textit{filling in}' missing data with plausible values, is an attractive approach to analyzing incomplete data. It apparently solves the missing-data problem at the beginning of the analysis. However, a naive or unprincipled imputation method may create more problems than it solves, distorting estimates, standard errors and hypothesis tests, as documented by Little and Rubin (1987) and others.
